## :thinking:  What is Protem?
Protem is a CLI where there is a set of projects to use, Protem will handle installing the node dependencies for the project (unless configured not to) along with any other requirements needed.

## :sunglasses: Why Protem?
Protem was made for convinence and ease-of-use. It gives you a starter template for a variety of projects, ranging from Discord bots (using Discord.js v12) to Express apps, and much more.

The file structure is already setup as well, with a clear description with what goes where and why in the `FILE_STRUCTURE.md` file. Protem also checks if the version is outdated to the latest version, and if so, notifys you that it is and that you should update. It also has a list of changes, but this is false by default.

## :gear: CLI Options
Everything is <b>optional</b> in the CLI, if all is left blank, it will create a "Hello world!" project.

`create-template` | default: `true` | short: `T`\
Enable or disable if you want to actually create a template, most of the time you won't update this unless you want to check updates.

`check-updates` | default: `true` | short: `U`\
Specify if you want to check for updates.

`list-changes` | default: `false` | short: `C`\
Show the list of changes if there is a new update.

`project` | default: `hello-world` | short: `p`\
This is the project to generate.

`new-directory` | default: `true` | short: `d`\
Specify if you want to make a new directory for the project (./protem/projectName).

`watermark` | default: `true` | short: `w`\
Include the watermark for Protem at the start of your project.

`install-dependencies` | default: `true` | short: `i`\
Specify if you want to install dependencies or not.

Example command: `protem --check-updates false --project express-hbs --new-directory false`
